<h1>Create a Network</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Open the Decawave DRTLS Manager application</li>
    <li>Tap ‘Start Device Discovery’</li>
    <li>Tap one of the discovered devices and an option will appear to name a network – this device will be added to that network</li>
    <li>Repeat for the remaining devices to add them to this network</li>
    <li>All units will initially appear as tags in ‘passive’ UWB mode</li>
</ol>

<h1>Configure the Units as Anchors or Tags</h1>

Tap the network and then tap each device in turn to configure it:
<ol>
    <li>First, identify the unit by unchecking the LED checkbox and tap accept button in upper right corner to save.
        The LEDs on that device will turn off.</li>
    <li>To configure the 4 anchors:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Set the ‘Node Type’ to ‘Anchor’</li>
            <li>Set ‘UWB’ to ‘Active’</li>
            <li>For any one of the anchors, check the ‘Initiator’ box (there must always be one initiator in the network)</li>
            <li>Tap accept button in upper right corner to save</li>

<h1>Auto-Position the Anchors (for up to 4 anchors)</h1>
</a>

<i>
    Note:  Using the Auto-Positioning function to automatically retrieve anchor locations is a <u>demonstration-only feature</u>.  For a commercial installation this feature should not be used.  Accurately measured anchor positions should be entered manually (see below).

<ol>
    <li>From the ‘Network Details’ screen, tap the “Auto-Position” button in the pull-down menu on the upper right</li>
    <li>A list of anchors (within Bluetooth range) appears</li>

        <ol type='a'>
            <li>Order the anchors to be anti-clockwise in the room</li>
            <li>The 1st anchor in the list is the (0,0) co-ordinate</li>
            <li>The 2nd anchor is to the right of the 1st (on the x-axis)</li>
            <li>The 3rd anchor should be positioned ‘above’ the 2nd, as it is viewed on the grid</li>
            <li>The 4th anchor should be positioned ‘above’ the 1st anchor</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Tap “Measure” to start the auto-positioning
